# üìö Library Store Management - SQL Project
This project focuses on designing and querying a relational database for a library management system. Built entirely using MySQL, the project simulates a real-world scenario where we manage book inventories, track loans, and maintain borrower and branch data efficiently.

# üèóÔ∏è Project Overview
The library_store database is structured to handle core operations of a library system. The schema includes tables for books, authors, publishers, borrowers, branches, and book loans. The project demonstrates key SQL skills such as data modeling, writing complex JOINs, and applying conditions to extract meaningful insights.

# üß± Database Schema
- The project includes the creation of the following tables:
- authors: Stores author details
- publisher: Holds publisher info including address and phone number
- books: Book details linked with publishers
- library_branch: Branch details with address
- book_copies: Tracks the number of copies per branch
- borrower: Stores borrower information
- book_loans: Manages which book was loaned by whom and when

# ‚ùì SQL Queries Answered
- Some of the key questions answered using SQL in this project:
- Copies of "The Lost Tribe" in Sharpstown Branch
- Copies of "The Lost Tribe" across all branches
- Borrowers with no books checked out
- Loan info (book title, borrower name, address) from Sharpstown with due date 2/3/18
- Total number of books loaned out per branch
- Borrowers with more than five books checked out
- Titles and number of copies authored by "Stephen King" in Central branch

# üß∞ Tools & Technologies Used
- Database: MySQL
- Environment: MySQL Workbench / Command Line
- Core Concepts: SQL joins, aggregation, filtering, data modeling

# ‚úÖ Outcomes
- Designed a normalized relational database from scratch
- Practiced SQL querying for real-world data retrieval scenarios
- Strengthened understanding of relational data handling and query optimization
